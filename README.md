## About Me
I am currently a student at Missouri University of Science and Technology based in Rolla, MO; I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am interested in writing code and creating efficient algorithms and applications. I have worked on multple projects, both academic and personal. 

Of my current projects, my favorite project is my python-based calculator. It is my favorite since it required me to learn new concepts in a language I was already comfortable in to make a working, interactable calculator. As I continue through college, I plan to update this git repository with new projects reflecting personal interests and academic challenges.
